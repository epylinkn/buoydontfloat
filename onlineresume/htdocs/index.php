<h2>About Me</h2>

<p style="margin: 0 50px;">“Whenever there is a hard job to be done I assign it to a lazy man; he is sure to find an easy way of doing it.” <br/><p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 50px;">-Walter Chrysler, founder of the Chrysler Corporation</p></p>

<p>This doesn't mean I am lazy (although I have my Sunday moments), it shows that great efficiency is not something you stumble upon.  Instead, it requires time, effort, incentive and the suspicion that there is a better way to do something.  It's up to you whether you take your chances with the lazy man or you find someone intelligent enough to look for you.  Someone say, with an Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Degree at the University of California, Berkeley--who's name starts with an 'A' and ends with an 'nthony'.</p>

<p>I'm crazy about making sense out of nonsense.  Give me muddled data, a peanut butter sandwich, and a coffee-maker and I will give you an in-depth analysis.  I’ve always believed that with the right knowledge and analysis, one can make well-informed decisions that significantly better the chances of success.</p>

<p>I love stochastic models whether they be full-scale simulations or back of the envelope drawings.  Models are a powerful tool that elucidate important concepts.  A powerful model </p>

<p>I’ve come to love the enthusiastic, fast-pace, and exciting atmosphere that a startup offers. I’d love to apply many of the concepts I’ve learned in addition to developing new ones. Startups offer the enthusiasm, expertise, and challenging work that I crave.</p>

<p>My breadth of knowledge and versatility and the fact that I enjoy doing projects, even if they don’t match my expertise or there is a lot of learning involved. </p>

<p>Welcome to my personal site. Feel free to check out some of my past projects and request a Curriculum Vitae if you are interested in working with me.  Also, if you want to know that I'm human, check out some of my other interests!</p>
